## Course Overview
As data and computational resources become ever more abundant, the ability to leverage both to gain insights take on an increasingly important role in our civilization. “Machine Learning” is an umbrella term for the algorithms, tools and approaches that promise to harness data in such a way. This class is a survey course intended to give an overview of all major flavors of Machine Learning. Importantly, we will place a particular emphasis on understanding the key algorithms employed in different subfields of Machine Learning, instead of treating them as a black box. Overall, the goal of this course is to enable students to become comfortable with the material to a point where they can pursue the study of more advanced topics in Machine Learning as well as employing Machine Learning methods to solve scientific and applied problems. In other words, the purpose of this class is to find out if Machine Learning is for you or not - and if it is, to enable you to pursue it further with confidence and competence.

### Target Audience
This course is aimed at 3rd or 4th year undergraduate students in computer science.

## Prerequisites
A strong foundation in **linear algebra, vector calculus, and introductory probability (standard probability distributions, continuous and discrete variables, expectations, and conditional expectation)**. Mathematical maturity and comfort with coding algorithms is required.

Required
* Data Structures (CSCI-UA.102) 
* Linear Algebra (MATH-UA.140)
* Probability and Statistics (MATH-UA.235)

Recommended
* CSCI-UA 310 Basic Algorithms
* DS-GA 1001 Introduction to Data Science 
    * Exercise materials are highly recommended.
* DS-GA 1002 Statistical and Mathematical Methods

<!-- ## Prerequisites
### CS/Data Science students
> This is NOT a basic course in reinforcement learning, deep learning or AI. If you are unsure about whether you are ready to take the class, go through [Assignment 0](assignments) to test yourself.

* Graduate level knowledge of **machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning** is assumed. 
* Proficiency in **Python and PyTorch** is assumed, and will be necessary to complete the [assignments](assignments).

### For non-DS/CS Students
Please contact Rosemary Amico <amico@cs.nyu.edu>. -->

## Logistical Overview

### Lecture
* 2:00pm-3:15pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays ([Class calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19hY3ZscGQ2ZWEzcXUxOGxvMDdvbDJjcGZuOEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)).
* Lectures will be online.
* The class will be recorded, we will post the link to the recorded lectures to the [class campuswire](https://campuswire.com/p/G6C251796/feed/).

### Grading and Assignments
1. Assignments (60%) + Capstone Project (30%) + Class Participating (10%)
2. There will be six homework assignments through the semester.
3. No late assignments will be accepted. This is a strict policy. 
7. Capstone Project Due: 14 December, 2022

<!-- ### Grading
1. [Homeworks](assignments) (60%)
2. Discussions, both in class and in [campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/G7204E992/) (10%)
3. Final Project (30%) -->

<!-- ### Assignments
* Assignments will use Python 3 and PyTorch; we will provide you a conda environment to install all dependencies.
* To complete the assignemnt, you would need GPU access. Use [Greene](https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/systems/greene-cluster) if you need access to one.
* We strongly recommended using Python for the project as well. -->

### Final Project (to be decided)
* Project proposals (1 page) will be due on 10/9.
* Maximum (and recommended) team size is 2.
* Final presentations of all projects will take place on 12/10/2021.

<!-- ### Course Textbook
We highly recommend the following e-book: **Sutton and Barto. _[Reinforcement Learning.](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf)_**. Reading materials for each class is posted in the [schedule](lectures). -->
