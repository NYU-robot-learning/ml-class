title: Assignments
---

There will be six homework assignments posted to the [class campuswire](https://campuswire.com/p/G6C251796/feed). They must be submitted online (platform TBD) and there will be no extensions. Each homework will include one or more programming assignments.

## Grading Rubric

| Attribute | Percentage of Total Score |
|---|---|
| Assignments (Each HW contributes 10% to overall score) | 60% |
| Capstone Project (Should be done individually. Will be scored on final report, interesting findings, methods tried out, final score on test set.) | 30% |
| Class Participation (includes asking questions in class, answering questions, initiating discussions, creating class-level blog posts of what was learned in a consumable form) | 10% |

## Assignment Structure
Each homework will comprise 10%-20% theoretical questions and 80%-90% coding questions. The theoretical portion of the assignment will be submitted in a Google Form (resubmittable till the due date of the respective assignments). The coding portion will have to be completed in the iPython notebook provided.

## Assignments

The assignments will be released on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/p/G6C251796/feed/2).

| Assignment | Release Date | Due Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HW 1: Math Foundations for ML | September 6 | September 20 |
| HW 2: Linear Regularization | September 20 | October 4 |  
| HW 3: Support Vector Machines | October 4 | October 18 |
| HW 4: Random Forests | October 18 | November 3 |
| HW 5: Convolutional Neural Networks | November 3 | November 17 |
| HW 6: Dimensionality Reduction | November 17 | December 1 |

## Collaboration Policy
Collaboration is encouraged, but the work you submit for assignments is expected to be entirely your own. That is, the writing and code must be yours, and you must fully understand everything that you hand in. Discussing the details of how to solve a problem is fine, but you must write the solution yourself. To avoid plagiarizing, you shouldn't be looking at someone else's solution while you write down your own. If you collaborated significantly (use your own discretion for "significantly") on a problem, list the people you collaborated with next to your solution.

## Capstone Project (need to decide structure)
* Project proposals (1 page) will be due on 10/9.
* Maximum (and recommended) team size is 2.
* Final presentations of all projects will take place on 12/10.
